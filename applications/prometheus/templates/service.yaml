# This manifest declares the Service which allows us to access our Prometheus
# cluster (either internally or externally).
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: prometheus
spec:
  # @TODO(mattjmcnaughton) We temporarily use a ClusterIP, because we don't want this externally accessible
  # from the internet until we have some form of authentication. We can't have
  # some form of meaningful authentication until we have https. We can access it
  # from our local machine using port forwarding. Once we have `https` and
  # authentication, we can make it a `LoadBalancer`.
  type: ClusterIP

  selector:
    # The CoreOS Prometheus operator assigns the `prometheus=prometheus` label
    # to all pods in the StatefulSet it creates for the Prometheus cluster.
