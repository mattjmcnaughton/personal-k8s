# This manifest is responsible for creating the Secret the CoreOS Prometheus
# Operator requires to configure Alertmanager instances:
# https://coreos.com/operators/prometheus/docs/latest/user-guides/alerting.html.
# It must be a secret because `alertmanager.yaml` could contain sensitive
# tokens. See the README for how we handle the secrets.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  # The Prometheus Operator requires we use the format `alertmanager-NAME`.

data:
  # The base64 encoded configuration file for our Alertmanager.
  #
  # We "pre-encode" this value as base64, instead of doing during the helm
  # templating, because it is an entire Yaml file. Its extremely difficult to
  # properly format an entire yaml file for helm templating, so instead we just
  # convert it to base64 early in the process.
