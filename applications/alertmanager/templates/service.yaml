# This manifest declares the Service which allows us to access Alertmanager
# (either internally or externally).
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: alertmanager
spec:
  # @TODO(mattjmcnaughton) We temporarily use a ClusterIP, because we don't want this externally accessible
  # from the internet until we have some form of authentication. We can't have
  # some form of meaningful authentication until we have https. We can access it
  # from our local machine using port forwarding. Once we have `https` and
  # authentication, we can make it a `LoadBalancer`.
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
  - name: web
    # By default, Alertmanager listens on port 9093.
    port: 9093
